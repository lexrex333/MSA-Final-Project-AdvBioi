# MSA-Final-Project-AdvBioi
Welcome! This is a walkthrough of benchmarking 4 different multiple sequence alignment (MSA) tools using an Ebola dataset. These 4 MSA software tools include: MAFFT, Halign3, MUSCLE, and ClustalOmega. 

5 Ebola species were used in this benchmarking project: [Bundibugyo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_014373?report=genbank), [Reston](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004161?report=genbank), [Sudan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_006432?report=genbank), [Tai](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_014372?report=genbank), and [Zaire](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002549?report=genbank). The DNA sequences can be downloaded from NCBI Genbank as a FASTA file. The Ebola dataset was recieved from: [Ebola Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914818300029).
